# EasyFEA - Easy Finite Element Analysis

## Overview

**EasyFEA** is a user-friendly Python library that simplifies finite element analysis. It is flexible and supports different types of simulation without requiring users to handle complex PDE formulations. The library currently supports four specific simulation types:

1. **ElasticSimu** (static and dynamic): Examples in `/examples/Elastic`, `/examples/Dynamic` and `/examples/Contact`.
2. **BeamSimu** (static Euler-Bernoulli): Examples in `/examples/Beam`.
3. **ThermalSimu** (stationary and transient): Examples in `/examples/Thermal`.
4. **PhaseFieldSimu:** (quasi-static phase field) Examples in `/examples/PhaseField`.

All examples are available [here](https://github.com/matnoel/EasyFEA/tree/master/examples).

For each simulation, users create a **mesh** and a **model**. Once the simulation has been set up, defining the boundary conditions, solving the problem and visualizing the results is straightforward.

Numerous examples of mesh creation are available in the `examples/Meshes` folder.

The simplest and quickest introduction is shown below and is available in `examples/HelloWorld.py`.

```python
from EasyFEA import (Display, Mesher, ElemType,
                     Materials, Simulations)
from EasyFEA.Geoms import Point, Domain

# ----------------------------------------------
# Mesh
# ----------------------------------------------
L = 120 # mm
h = 13

domain = Domain(Point(), Point(L,h), h/5*2)
mesh = Mesher().Mesh_2D(domain, [], ElemType.QUAD4, isOrganised=True)

# ----------------------------------------------
# Simulation
# ----------------------------------------------
E = 210000 # MPa
v = .3
F = -800 # N

mat = Materials.Elas_Isot(2, E, v, planeStress=True, thickness=h)

simu = Simulations.ElasticSimu(mesh, mat)

nodesX0 = mesh.Nodes_Conditions(lambda x,y,z: x==0)
nodesXL = mesh.Nodes_Conditions(lambda x,y,z: x==L)

simu.add_dirichlet(nodesX0, [0]*2, ["x","y"])
simu.add_surfLoad(nodesXL, [F/h/h], ["y"])

simu.Solve()

# ----------------------------------------------
# Results
# ----------------------------------------------
Display.Plot_Mesh(mesh)
Display.Plot_BoundaryConditions(simu)
Display.Plot_Result(simu, 'uy', plotMesh=True)
Display.Plot_Result(simu, 'Svm', plotMesh=True, ncolors=11)

Display.plt.show()
```

## Installation

EasyFEA can be easily installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/EasyFEA/) using pip, compatible with Python versions 3.9 through 3.12:

```
pip install EasyFEA
```

### Dependencies

EasyFEA uses several libraries such as NumPy and Gmsh - as such, the following projects are required dependencies of EasyFEA:

+ [`numpy`](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) - Fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
+ [`gmsh`](https://pypi.org/project/gmsh/) (>= 4.12) - Three-dimensional finite element mesh generator.
+ [`scipy`](https://pypi.org/project/scipy/) - Fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
+ [`matplotlib`](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/) - Plotting package.
+ [`pyvista`](https://pypi.org/project/pyvista/) - Plotting package.
+ [`numba`](https://pypi.org/project/numba/) - Compiling Python code using LLVM.
+ [`pandas`](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) (3.9 <= Python <= 3.12) - Powerful data structures for data analysis.
+ [`imageio`](https://pypi.org/project/imageio/) and [`imageio[ffmpeg]`](https://pypi.org/project/imageio-ffmpeg/) - Library for reading and writing a wide range of image, video, scientific, and volumetric data formats.

For detailed information on installing [`numba`]((https://pypi.org/project/numba/)), refer to the [Numba Installation Guide](https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/installing.html#numba-support-info).

### Optional Dependencies

EasyFEA includes a few optional dependencies for reducing resolution time or for performing DIC:

+ [`pypardiso`](https://pypi.org/project/pypardiso/) (Python > 3.8 & Intel oneAPI)  - Library for solving large systems of sparse linear equations.
+ [`petsc`](https://pypi.org/project/petsc/) and [`petsc4py`](https://pypi.org/project/petsc4py/) - Python bindings for PETSc.
+ [`opencv-python`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) - Computer Vision package.

# Naming conventions

**EasyFEA** uses Object-Oriented Programming ([OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)) with the following naming conventions:
+ `PascalCasing` for classes
+ `camelCasing` for properties
+ `Snake_Casing` or `Snake_casing` for functions/methods

In this library, objects can contain both **public** and **private** properties or functions.

**Private** parameters or functions are designated by a double underscore, such as `__privateParam`. In addition, parameters or functions beginning with an underscore, such as `_My_Function` are accessible to advanced users, but should be used with caution.

# Contributing

Contributors are welcome! To contribute please use the following commands.

```
git clone https://github.com/matnoel/EasyFEA.git
cd EasyFEA
python -m pip install -e .
```

In editable mode (`-e`), code completion functionality may be compromised in your integrated development environment ([IDE](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environnement_de_d%C3%A9veloppement)). To enable code completion, it is necessary to include the **EasyFEA** directory path in the additional resolution paths for the import search.

For example, in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), you can achieve this by adding `<folder>/EasyFEA/` to "Python > Analysis: **Extra Paths**" in the Pylance extension settings. Here, `<folder>` indicates the path to the directory containing `EasyFEA/`.

To develop a **new feature**, start by creating a new branch in the project via the `git branch my_new_feature` command. Then, after implementing and validating your changes with **tests** (see `EasyFEA/tests/` for tips), start initiating a pull request to integrate your changes.

**EasyFEA** is an emerging project with a strong commitment to growth and improvement. Your input and ideas are invaluable to me. I welcome your comments and advice with open arms, encouraging a culture of respect and kindness in our collaborative journey towards improvement.

# Developments

This code was initially developed by [Matthieu Noel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthieu-no%C3%ABl/) as part of a PhD thesis carried out at the [MSME](https://msme.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/) laboratory and in collaboration with the furniture division of the [FCBA](https://www.fcba.fr/) technology institute.
